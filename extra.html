        <h1>My Favorite Cars</h1>
        <p><a class="light">My all time favorite car is the <em>1963 Corvette Stingray Split Window</em>. In my opinion, this is the most <br>beautiful car in the world and nobody can change
             my mind. My favorite part of this car is the rear <br>window design. It is a boat tail design with two pieces of curved glass and a split down the middle.</a></p><br>
        <p><a class="medium">My second favorite car is the <em>1971 Buick Riviera</em>. There is not a single part of this car that looks <br>imperfect. This car also shares a boat tail rear 
            window with the Stingray, but it has a very cool front<br> end as well. The side profile looks super sleek and sporty, as it should.</a></p><br>
        <p><a class="dark">My third favorite car is the <em>1957 Buick Skylark Convertible</em>. This car has the most beautiful side profile <br>of any 50s car I know. Most cars from the 
            40s and 50s have over dramatic body lines that make them look <br>almost cartoonish, but Buick did it almost perfect. Its not too tall, too round, or too long. 
            Its just perfect.</a></p>
