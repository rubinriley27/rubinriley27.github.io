                <h2>By Riley Rubin</h2>

                <h1>12/22/1976, Utah, USA</h1>

                <p>It was a quiet morning like any other. I woke up, ate breakfast<br> and went to work. Little did I know, today would change<br> history. I worked at an observatory mainly focused on<br> studying other planets. Just before lunch, me and some of my<br> coworkers noticed something very strange on Mars that none<br> of us could explain. There was a series of flashes, almost<br> identical to a rocket launching, over and over coming from the<br> surface of the red planet. Two at a time, a total of sixteen of<br> these flashes happened, then nothing for about five minutes.<br> What looked like three lasers streamed towards Earth at the<br> speed of light with little to no warning. They were here in a<br> few minutes and stopped instantly upon reaching orbit.</p>

                <h1>The Encounter</h1>
                <p>The sixteen objects were sitting perfectly still, looking like<br> small blue lights in the sky, barely visible to the naked eye,<br> but upon closer inspection through the telescope were what<br> looked like spaceships. They were triangular with three<br> rocket engines on the back and a blue light centered on the<br> bottom. They were all different sizes and in a formation.<br> Two giant ones in the middle, four slightly smaller ones<br> surrounding them, and ten very small ones scattered around<br> in an organized pattern around the group. One of the big<br> ships launched some kind of drop pod that plummeted<br> towards the ground in a ball of fire. It landed on the side of a<br> back road just out of town. Some of us ran outside, jumped in<br> our cars and started racing down the road. When we arrived<br> at the scene there was a huge crowd of cars and people<br> stopped staring  at the object. I made my way through the<br> crowd until I saw it. There was a strange arrowhead shaped<br> object. It was shiny but not very reflective, like polished<br> aluminum but darker and it had a light blue light on the top.<br> A line of light started at the bottom and slowly moved to the<br> top then two doors opened slowly, revealing the creature inside.</p>

                <h1>Communication</h1>
                <p>An acidic feeling filled the air as the creature stepped out of<br> the pod without a scratch, despite the rough landing. As it<br> touched the grass, it began to die and the scent of burnt<br> leather was pointing in the direction towards it. The alien was<br> tall with four arms and big hands, it had four eyes and light<br> grey patterned skin that looked very dry. It began looking back<br> and fourth, scanning the crowd of concerned people.</p>

                <h1>The Start Of The End</h1>
                <p>The county sheriff was among the crowd, previously too<br> stunned to speak, he stood there. He eventually made a<br> decision without thinking, one that would change<br> everything. He drew his sidearm and aimed it at the<br> creature. It immediately made a noise that sounded like a<br> viking war horn and threw something at the sheriff killing<br> him instantly. The ships from above descended through the<br> atmosphere and started opening fire upon every single<br> person they could see. I was thinking quickly and dove<br> under one of the cars next to me as I witnessed mass<br> destruction follow around in every direction. All I could hear<br> was screaming, gunfire, and explosions. I also heard the<br> familiar sound of fighter jets screaming overhead. I peaked<br> out for a second to see one firing missiles at the spaceships,<br> doing absolutely no damage, then getting struck from the sky<br> and plummeting to the ground in a ball of fire. I stayed still<br> under the car until all nearby noises stopped, then climbed out<br> and what I saw was something I couldn’t comprehend.<br> Everything around me was destroyed, collapsed, and on fire.<br> It looked like there was a war that lasted many years, but it<br> happened in only hours.</p>
