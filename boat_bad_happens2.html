        <h1>You Have Angered It</h1>
        <p>You grab the machete from the cabinet, and turn to the tentacle crushing the deck. You raise your right<br>hand and chop as hard as you can. Your attack was pointless,
             the machete broke on the creatures armor<br>leaving nothing but a scratch. The creature stops everytrhing it is doing, rises out of the water, grabs you<br>and drags you
              under water.</p>
