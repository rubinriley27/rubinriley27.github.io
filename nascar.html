                <h1>The Origins</h1>
                <p>Before NASCAR became a thing, during prohibition, bootleggers<br> started modifying cars to be able to escape the police. They would<br> modify the engine to be more powerful, take out the passenger<br> and rear seats to store as much liquor as possible, add more<br> suspension springs to handle the extra weight, and put a dirt<br> protecting plate in front of the radiator.These cars would remain<br> looking almost stock on the outside. These people would transport<br> mass amounts of liquor to hidden bars behind normal businesses,<br> and if they were caught, they had no problem running.<br><br> When prohibition ended, the bootleggers still wanted a way to feel<br> the adrenaline of driving as fast as they could.</p>

                <h1>The Series</h1>
                <p>	In 1948, Bill France Sr. founded the National Association for Stock<br> Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) and held the very first race on Daytona<br> Beach, Florida February 15, 1948.<br><br>
	                The rules stated that the cars had to be strictly “stock”, right off the<br> showroom floor. The only addition that could be made was a paint job<br> to signify the team.
                </p>
                <h1>How The Cars Evolved</h1>
                <p>At first, the cars started to get heavier but with bigger engines. In the<br> 50s, the cars started getting lighter and more sporty, engines kept<br> getting bigger, some cars started reaching 200mph. The newer cars<br> became less and less like stock cars and more like a roll cage with a<br> body. The cars started getting so fast that it became a safety hazard, so<br> rules started regulating the speed.
                <h1>What It Is Today</h1>
                <p>Modern nascars are almost entirely roll cage, keeping safety over<br> everything else. They have a thin flexible body that allows the inner<br> parts of the car to do its job in the event of a crash, they also have rear<br> facing roof flaps to try and keep the car on the ground if it were to<br> spin out. These cars are designed specifically with aerodynamics<br> in mind.</p>
                </p>
                <h1>Types Of Tracks</h1>
                <p>There is more to NASCAR than just driving in a circle, sure thats most<br> of it but there are other types of tracks, like Circuit of the Americas and<br> many more, every track is different and they all have their own<br> challenges as well.</p>
                <h1>Types Of Cars</h1>
                <p>There is also more than just cars. The cup series, and xfinity series are<br> the most popular, but there is also the craftsman truck series that adds<br> a new tier of car to the list, and a unique one at that.</p>
                <h1>In Conclusion</h1>
                <p>NASCAR has more to it than most people realise and the history behind<br> it is very interesting.</p>
