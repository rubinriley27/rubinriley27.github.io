        <h1>Freedom But At What Cost</h1>
        <p>You haven't spotted the creature yet, but unknown to you it has you in its sights. The boat starts rocking more and more, eventually<br>getting to the point where the waves could not be causing it. Then you notice a scraping noise as the tentacle of the creature slams into the<br>side of the boat leaving a huge gash. You have to make the decision to run across the deck and grab the shotgun. You shoot once, nothing.<br>Twice, nothing. Then finally the third shot hits. The creature lets out a terrible scream and diverts its coarse.<br><br>The further you get from the scene, the more the storm calms. Eventually there is nothing but calm seas again.<br><br></p>
        <p>You have escaped for now but the creature still lurks in the deep, waiting for its next victim</p>
