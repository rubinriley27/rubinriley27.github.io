        <h1>The Story</h1>

        <p>There was a story that <em>I</em> had to write for this funny little class called <em> <Strong>Computer Science</Strong> </em> , it was for my first project that I enjoyed deeply.</p>

        <h2>Hello World</h2>

        <p>I have a feeling, I did what <em>Mr. McGee</em> wanted.</p>
        <p>After this he wanted me to make him a list. The contents could be random, so they include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The keys to a random car, "Apparently"</li>
                <li>2 Bars of pure copper, "For some reason"</li>
                <li>1/2 a can of silly string, "I don't know why"</li>
            </ul>
        <p>I don't know why I decided to do this, I just did.</p>
