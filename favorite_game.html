                    <td>9.0/10</td>
                    <td>Trailmakers has and infinite amount of creativity, but tricky to unskilled minds. I started playing it at release and it very quickly became my favorite game. I have the freedom to build whatever I can come up with. the only two downsides are the complexity limit of creations and the fact that this game crashes more than any other game I have ever played.</td>

                    <td>9.0/10</td>
                    <td>Helldivers gives me the perfect PvE battles with many different objectives to fight for. My favorite factions to play are bugs or the illuminate. Bugs give me the thrill of constant battle and a wide range of otherworldly terrain, and playing the illuminate give you more tactful options like stealth.</td>

                    <td>8.5/10</td>
                    <td>Subnautica is one of my absolute favorite survival games purely for the fact that it is completely unique from all others. Most survival games, I will beat only once. Subnautica has brought me back multiple times because there is always more to explore. The one thing I like more about Subnautica than most survival games is the ability to build vehicles. building vehicles is helpful, but not overpowered. every vehicle comes with its own problems as well. My favorite is the P.R.A.W.N. Suit. With is i have challenged and beat every dangerous creature in battle, I fear nothing</td>

                    <td>7.0/10</td>
                    <td>Astroneer one of my favorite exploration/automation games. automating absolutely any process is possible, and the planets are all unique. There is seven planets, two of which are moons: Sylva, Desolo, Vesania, Novus, Calidor, Glacio, and Atrox. Sylva is the starter planet, and is the most like earth, with mountains and forests. Desolo is the moon of Sylva, being the best place to get tungsten, but good for nothing else. Vesania is my second least favorite planet because of its wierd wavy terrain. Novus is the moon of Vesania, and has terrain just like Desolo, but pink. Calidor is a desert planet with huge caves and plateau mountains. Glacio is the opposite, being entirely frozen with jagged spikes evrywhere. Lastly Atrox is my least favorite planet, absolutely everything wants to kill you. The Glitchwakers update added a new planet called Aolus that is a mix of all the others. I have beat the game 6 times, doing different things each time.</td>
